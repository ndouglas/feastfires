# Feastfires
A simple application for transforming API data into Ignition configuration.

Specifically, its purpose in life is to retrieve data from [Hellholt](https://github.com/ndouglas/hellholt) for use by [Bitterbridge](https://github.com/ndouglas/bitterbridge).  This is based on work (a substantial amount of work) I did ~4 years ago, whose fruits live on only in my dotfiles.

## Acknowledgements
This application is named after [Feastfires](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Feastfires), a castle in _A Song of Ice and Fire_.  In my home network, I name hosts after noble houses from _ASoIaF_ and major projects after castles.  This saves me from having to spend too much time trying to name things.
