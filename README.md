A simple application for transforming API data into Ignition configuration.

Specifically, its purpose in life is to retrieve data from [Hellholt](https://github.com/ndouglas/hellholt) for use by [Bitterbridge](https://github.com/ndouglas/bitterbridge).  This is based on work (a substantial amount of work) I did ~4 years ago, whose fruits live on only in my dotfiles.
